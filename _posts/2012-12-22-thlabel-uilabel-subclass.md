I am releasing a UILabel subclass, which allows shadow blur, stroke text and fill gradient. You can find it here: [tobihagemann/THLabel][thlabel]{:target="_blank"}

I know that there are already classes out there like [OHAttributedLabel][ohattributedlabel]{:target="_blank"}, [FXLabel][fxlabel]{:target="_blank"} and [KSLabel][kslabel]{:target="_blank"}, but none of them fulfilled all my needs for my game. My motivation was:

- I needed an outer stroke, which seems to be kind of special, because Core Graphics only can centered stroke. I found the neat solution in KSLabel, which doubles the stroke size and draws the text just over it again, which cuts the stroke into halves.
- The stroke manipulates the character glyph widths, which has to be dealt with in all style operations. I came up with the idea of using invisible strokes, which works perfectly.
- Shadow has to be also thrown off by the stroke, not the text only!

Thanks to Kai Schweiger for making [KSLabel][kslabel]{:target="_blank"}, which started my own implementation, and Nick Lockwood for making [FXLabel][fxlabel]{:target="_blank"}, which is just insanely great, and I adapted most of his framework.

I had to reorganize the `drawRect:` method several times, which caused me a lot of headache. :smile: For learning purposes I built the class from ground up, that's why I didn't just enhance FXLabel for example.

If you find any bugs or want to give feedback, I'm happy to hear them! :smile:

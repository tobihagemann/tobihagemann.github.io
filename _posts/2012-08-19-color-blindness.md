This is one of the "facepalm moments". My upcoming game is all about colors and I haven't even considered color blind people. The most frequent form is red-green color blindness (7 to 10% of all males, females should be under 1%, it's a chromosome thing) [[source]][wp-color-blindness]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. That's a lot of people and I'm glad I got this hint before release. :smile:

Now I'm going to replace green with yellow. I know that there is also a blue-yellow color blindness (and I guess other forms), but they are rarer and I can't consider every form, because then I would get out of distinct colors! :wink: I have to say that it's quite nerve-racking now, because I have to change a lot of things in this stage of development, but it's absolutely necessary!

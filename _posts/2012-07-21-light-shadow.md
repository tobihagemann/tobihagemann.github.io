excerpt: "I'm not an artist. I have no clue how lights and shadows work, but I'm trying to get a sense of it. A lot of work I've done so far, was just pure intuition. Recently I came across a tutorial for pixel art and found the links to a quick guide and a complete one on lights and shadows. That was a really good lesson! I'm not using any pixel art, but the process of making graphics has similarities to \"normal\" art. That's when I realized that lights and shadows aren't only important in level design, but overall in graphics. That's why I'm slowly adapting what I've learned to UI elements. Pretty neat!"

I'm not an artist. I have no clue how lights and shadows work, but I'm trying to get a sense of it. A lot of work I've done so far, was just pure intuition. Recently I came across a tutorial for [pixel art][pixel-art] and found the links to a [quick guide][quick-guide] and a [complete one][complete-guide] on lights and shadows.

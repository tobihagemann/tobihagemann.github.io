<p class="lead" markdown="1">Oh boy, here we go again. Even though it would be fitting to review the whole decade, I'll save me some time and just review 2019 as I've done [last year][reviewing-2018-post] with my very own "best of" lists.</p>

## Movies
I've watched 44 movies in 2019 (and 23 of them were from 2019). That's 11 more than last year. Hooray?

My favorite movie of 2019 is [The Game Changers][the-game-changers]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}! Yeah, it's a documentary, I don't care. :smile: Screw every Disney movie that [dominated 80% of 2019's top box office][disney-box-office-2019]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Just kidding, I enjoyed them all. :laughing: But _The Game Changers_ actually changed my game and I have been considering more vegan/vegeterian options than before. Maybe it will change your game, too?

Apart from that, _Joker_ obviously is a fantastic movie. It's so obvious that it would be a scandal if Joaquin Phoenix wouldn't get an Oscar next year.

## TV Shows
My favorite new(!) TV show of 2019 is [Chernobyl][chernobyl]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. It's probably even my favorite TV show of the decade.

</div>

Runner-ups are _The Mandalorian_, _When They See Us_, _How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)_, and _The Morning Show_.

I guess we can all agree that we were all very disappointed by the _Game of Thrones_ series finale? :joy:

## YouTube
I don't actually have a favorite YouTube video this year. But I certainly have a new favorite channel. So my favorite YouTube channel of 2019 is [Finanzfluss][finanzfluss]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. It's a German channel but with help of Finanzfluss's videos, I felt confident enough to invest in ETFs. That was probably another game changer for me this year.

</div>

Some other channels that I've subscribed to this year and I've thoroughly enjoyed so far: [Technology Connections][technology-connections]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [Mark Rober][mark-rober]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and [Christine McConnell][christine-mcconnell]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

## Games
My favorite game of 2019 is [Ring Fit Adventure][ring-fit-adventure]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. I guess that's my third game changer of this year. I started working out before this game came out but it has easily become my workout routine right now. It's fun, it has a lot of and diverse exercises, and it's quite effective.

  <p class="figure-caption" markdown="1">[Ring Fit Adventure - Launch Trailer][ring-fit-adventure-trailer]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} by Nintendo</p>
</div>

Runner-ups are _Luigi's Mansion 3_ and _Untitled Goose Game_. I guess I haven't played that many games this year. :smile:

Buuut I'd still like to mention that I'm currently enjoying _Beat Saber_ a lot. It's technically not a new game from this year but I recently got an Oculus Quest and I've just started to get into Expert+ in Beat Saber (and wow, do I suck at the moment).

## Music
My habits haven't changed, I'm still listening to the songs that I like from Discover Weekly on Spotify. You can listen to my top 100 songs of 2019 [in this Spotify playlist][top-100-songs-playlist]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. My top 5 songs of this year are

- [Remembrance - Shingo Nakamura Remix by Kenji Sekiguchi, Shingo Nakamura][remembrance],
- [Keep It Together by LGHTNNG][keep-it-together],
- [Flashback to Holly by XENNON][flashback-to-holly],
- [Synthetic Life by Julian Emery, Dana Jean Phoenix][synthetic-life], and
- [Space Log (2017 Version) by Sung][space-log].

At least according to Spotify. If I have to pick one, _Flashback to Holly_ is my favorite song of 2019. I wish I could find lyrics for it somewhere because I don't understand every word. :joy:

Th-th-th-that's all folks! Happy new year and happy new decade! :tada:

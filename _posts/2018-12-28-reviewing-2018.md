<p class="lead" markdown="1">Another year, another review. I'll mostly stick to the format of [last year's review][reviewing-2017-post] and present to you my own "best of" lists.</p>

## Movies
This year, I started tracking the movies I've watched: 33 movies in 2018 (but only 14 of them were from 2018).

My favorite movie of 2018 is [Avengers: Infinity War][avengers-infinity-war]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}! Yes, yes, sounds like an easy choice but I actually watched it twice in the cinema and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm absolutely looking forward to _Avengers: Endgame_ next year!!

Interestingly, there were a lot of sequels this year: _Deadpool 2_, _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ (second Jurassic World), _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ (second Ant-Man), _The Equalizer 2_, _Sicario 2_, _Incredibles 2_, _Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald_ (second Fantastic Beasts). :thinking:

I was quite excited to watch _Ready Player One_ because I've read the book, which I liked very much, many years ago (I rarely read books :see_no_evil:) but the movie is "okay". :joy:

## TV Shows
My favorite new(!) TV show of 2018 is [Maniac][maniac]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. It's actually a mini-series but whatever. :laughing: Netflix delivers once again.

</div>

I don't have runner-ups this year, nothing new really stood out. If you like to watch documentaries, I can recommend _Vitamania_ and _Big Cats_.

Ongoing shows like _Legion_, _Westworld_, _Better Call Saul_, and _Daredevil_ had very strong seasons this year. :+1: I'm looking forward to the series finale of _Game of Thrones_ next year! :raised_hands:

## YouTube
My favorite YouTube video of 2018 is [Rusty Deadlocked Vice - Perfect Restoration][rusty-deadlocked-vice]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} by [my mechanics][my-mechanics]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

</div>

Since YouTube doesn't have a subscription history, I created a list on my own since my last year's review. This year, I've subscribed to these channels: [Gus Johnson][gus-johnson]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [videogamedunkey][videogamedunkey]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [Steve Schoger][steve-schoger]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [DoodleChaos][doodlechaos]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [PaymoneyWubby][paymoneywubby]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, [my mechanics][my-mechanics]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and [Jablinski Games][jablinski-games]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

I'm not so sure about the last one yet because I just got hooked by the hype. We'll see if it's a shitty channel or not. Other than that, I'm quite happy with the content of the channels I've subscribed to this year.

## Games
My favorite game of 2018 is [Pokémon: Let's Go][pokemon-lets-go]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. I haven't played a game so intensely without getting stressed or bored for a very long time. Nostalgia hit me hard.

</div>

Runner-ups are _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ and _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_. As you can see, I'm still a big fan of Nintendo Switch and its games.

Oh well, maybe it's worth mentioning that I also enjoyed playing _Minit_ this year.

## Music
Most of the time, I'm listening to the songs that I like from Discover Weekly on Spotify. You can listen to my top 100 songs of 2018 [in this Spotify playlist][top-100-songs-playlist]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This year I really enjoyed [Earth Past by Flite][earth-past], [The Silence by Grafton Primary][the-silence], [Heartbeat (feat. Basile Di Manski) by Data][heartbeat], [The Moment - Instrumental by Mad Blade Beats][the-moment], and [Hazy by Thought Beings][hazy].

I noticed that I don't even look at the artist's names anymore. I was actually very surprised who Flite was while writing this blog post. And it looks like that I listened 5,670 more minutes to music on Spotify than last year.

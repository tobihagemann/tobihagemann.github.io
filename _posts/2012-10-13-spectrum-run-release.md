As you may know, Spectrum Run finally has been released! You can get it [here][spectrum-run]{:target="_blank"}. The past two weeks were crazy. It obviously started with submitting Spectrum Run to Apple. After 10 days staring at the status "Waiting For Review", it switched to "In Review". 3 hours later the game got rejected, because I used misleading Achievement titles, which were too similar to an Apple Trademark. Yeah whatever, I didn't even think of it, but no problem, I fixed (or changed) it instantly. I had to wait another day until the status went from "Rejected" to "In Review" once again. This time I had to wait 7 hours and the status finally went to "Ready For Sale". :smile: It was 4 am in Germany and I checked my phone at 5 am, because I got awake by accident, and certainly couldn't continue sleeping anymore after those pleasent news! :laughing:

I have learned so much in the last 6 months, but there's still a lot do. I'm considering every feedback and make the game better with Updates!

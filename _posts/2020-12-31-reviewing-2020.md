<p class="lead" markdown="1">I actually wasn't sure if I wanted to review 2020 buuut let's keep the tradition going, shall we? :grin:</p>

This year didn't turn out as all of us have expected, did it? We all had to adjust our lives (some more, some less). Fortunately, I wasn't affected by the pandemic too much. I'm in a happy relationship since the beginning of the year. Our business at Skymatic just saw a small dent in March but we had a successful year otherwise.

Even though I tried to consume "less" media this year and tried to filter everything that is just stealing my time, I'll review 2020 as usual with my own "best of" lists.

## Movies
I've watched 38 movies in 2020 (and 6 of them were from 2020). That's 6 fewer than last year… and not a lot from the current year?

My favorite movie of 2020 is [Soul][soul]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}! I loved the concept and cried at the end. Pixar never disappoints.

I love going to movie theaters. Thanks to the virus, that wasn't an option anymore (at least for me). I haven't even watched _Tenet_ yet, which makes me sad. It's probably a great movie, could've even been my favorite movie of the year. :disappointed: And I didn't know until yesterday that _Bill & Ted Face the Music_ has been released. I'm not up-to-date anymore.

## TV Shows
My favorite new(!) TV show of 2020 is [Ted Lasso][ted-lasso]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. It's funny and we all could use a good laugh. :joy:

</div>

I don't have any runner-ups this year because I didn't watch a lot of TV shows either. :sweat_smile: I'm pretty sure that I missed a lot of great new TV shows this year that you all can tell me about.

## YouTube
My favorite YouTube video of 2020 is [Uncle Roger DISGUSTED by this Egg Fried Rice Video (BBC Food)][egg-fried-rice]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} by [mrnigelng][mrnigelng]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. I guess I liked comedy this year. "Haiyaa!" is part of my vocabulary now. :laughing:

## Games
I don't have a favorite game of 2020. But I'd like to share this great document: [Options for Online Board Games][online-board-games]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

It's a huge list of options to play in online groups during these social distancing times. I think that's more worth than a single title.

## Music
I got tired of going through my Discover Weekly list on Spotify. Therefore, I listened to a lot of "old" music this year. You can listen to my top 100 songs of 2020 [in this Spotify playlist][top-100-songs-playlist]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. My top 5 songs of this year are

- [Life Of Sin Pt. 6 by MitiS][life-of-sin-pt-6],
- [You Know That You Love Me by PRIZM][you-know-that-you-love-me],
- [Legacy Rule by Qwazi][legacy-rule],
- [Shadows - RMX by Uppermost][shadows], and
- [Strobe by deadmau5][strobe].

At least that's what I listened to most on Spotify. It's funny that _Strobe_ got on that list, which is my favorite song ever. According to Last.fm, I've listened to it 3,483 times already (over 25 days of continuous play).

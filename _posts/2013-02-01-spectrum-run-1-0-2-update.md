Spectrum Run 1.0.2 update just [came out][spectrum-run]{:target="_blank"} and offers more iOS 6 features. The changes are:

- New Challenge feature (iOS 6 only!)
- Native iOS 6 support of sharing on Facebook
- Bug Fixes & Other Improvements

Maybe you've seen [my twitter post][tweet]{:target="_blank"} two weeks ago, I put a lot of effort to make this screen look right and good. In the process I've published [THLabel][thlabel-uilabel-subclass-post], a generic UILabel subclass, which additionally allows shadow blur, stroke text and fill gradient.

I've been and I'll still be very busy with other projects (all app-related :smile:), so don't expect major updates on Spectrum Run anytime soon. I'll talk about one of the new apps pretty soon, so stay tuned! :)

P.S.: There is a bug in the new challenge feature. I just submitted a hotfix, which should be available next week! :wink: Whoopsie!
